# HemmingWeight
Your client wants you to write an API that calculates the Hamming weight of a number. The
Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from zero. E.g.,
01234 → 4, 012012 → 4, 000050000 → 1. The API should also save the last string and
should be able to return it (since the application was (re)started, no need to use a database).
